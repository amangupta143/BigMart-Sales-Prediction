<p>This project implements an XGBoost regression model to forecast sales for various products across different stores in the BigMart retail chain.</p>


<!--- Objective Section --->
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal is to create a model that helps BigMart understand which product and store characteristics have the biggest impact on sales, allowing them to optimize their strategies. ðŸ“ˆ</p>


<!--- Data Section --->
<h2>Data</h2>
The project utilizes publicly available product and store data, accessible on Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data" >BigMart Sales Data</a>.

The dataset includes information on:

- 1559 unique items
- 10 stores


<!--- Features Section --->

- **Product Information:**
    - Item_Identifier (Unique product ID)
    - Item_Weight (Weight of product)
    - Item_Fat_Content (Low fat or not)
    - Item_Visibility (% of display area allocated to the product)
    - Item_Type (Category of the product)
    - Item_MRP (Maximum Retail Price)
- **Store Information:**
    - Outlet_Identifier (Unique store ID)
    - Outlet_Establishment_Year (Year the store opened)

    - Outlet_Type (Grocery store or supermarket)
- **Sales Data:**
    - Item_Outlet_Sales (Sales figures for each product at each store)


 <!--- Model Section --->
<h2>Model</h2>

<p>The project employs XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting library, to build a regression model that predicts future sales.</p>
